Plan for the course
===================


The idea is to present some statistical results in an intuitive manner.
By the end of the course, the students should be able to understand:

 - what are the main differences between frequentist and Bayesian statistics
 	. problems with p-values, confidence intervals and null hypothesis testing
 - how to assign probability distributions
 	. the role of priors
 	. the likelihood
 - the simplest models in Bayesian statistics: linear regression, beta-binomial model, hierarchical models
 - what is an MCMC, how it works and why it works; shortcomings and alternatives
